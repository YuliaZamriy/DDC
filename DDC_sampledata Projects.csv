HVAC AIRFLOW ISSUES
This scope includes the installation of a new transfer air fan and associated ductwork with sound attenuation on the inlet and outlet of a fan serving the Judge’s Lounge located at the 7th Floor.  New transfer air ducts are being installed on floors 2, 7 & 8 to assist in the proper function of the return air system. Additional fan coil units are being installed to serve several rooms on the 8th floor & the 7th floor elevator lobby.

ENGINATOR EXHAUST HEAT
This scope involves a means of venting excessive heat that builds up in a shaft way that houses the enginator exhaust pipe that begins in lower level 2 up and out through the roof of the building. The heat emanates through the shaft way walls into the building.  This will be accomplished by installing a new exhaust fan and a makeup air fan that pumps outside air into the shaft way.

CURTAINWALL SHADOW BOX HEAT TRANSFER
Original design created conditions where curtain wall mullions heated to temperatures in excess of 110 F. This scope of works involves installing new metal stud with sheetrock finishes over interior curtain wall mullions. Affected locations are portions of the 2nd floor east side exposure.

WATER PENETRATION THROUGH UNDERGROUND CONDUITS
An existing underground conduit experienced water infiltration which caused those conductors to fail. Those conductors are going to be removed and the conduit abandoned. A new above ground path has been designed for the new feeder.

INTERIOR GLASS REPLACEMENT
Replace 4 sections of glazing at Stair A and 1 section at Stair B.

CONDENSER WATER SYSTEM WITH THREE ROOF TOP DRY COOLERS
Furnish and install a complete new A/C condenser cooling glycol system that includes roof top dry coolers and associated piping. This new system will serve chilled water A/C units in IT closets and elevator machine rooms throughout the building.","HVAC AIRFLOW ISSUES
